Breadcrumb
------------------------------------

Version: 1.0
Author: Alistair Kearney (alistair@symphony21.com)
Build Date: 2nd Jan 2009
Requirements: Latest Symphony 2 build

Includes a Data Source that, based on the current page, will provide a focused XML structure representing the
parent hierarchy. It is more efficient than a conventional Navigation DS, since there is less redundant data
and is much easier to traverse with xpath

1. Upload the 'breadcrumb' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.
